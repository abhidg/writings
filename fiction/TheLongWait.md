# The Long Wait

A (very) short story by Abhishek Dasgupta  
Written sometime in June 2007

The rain splashed onto the earth, rippled across the river. The grey clouds
loomed, thundered -- rivulets ran down the dusty window sill, of a house
that lay forgotten in the green valley.

Inside the house, stood a boy, waiting.

He has waited for many years. Not many have seen him, but all who have
agreed that he was different.

He knew he would have to keep on waiting. He knew what he wanted, but it
would prove difficult to make it come to pass.

Would it come? His round, boyish face looked upward through the
rain-streaked glass, toward the ancient stars, but not the ones of memory.
Time swept by unheeded as he stayed and watched.

Many would think that he was waiting for news; certainly said the
townsfolk, he could not be a human, for decades had passed and no lines
showed upon the watcher's face. They were wrong.

For human he was indeed, though little similarity could be discerned on
first sight. He was a traveller through time and had been stranded in our
age by an accident, which had taken with it the rest of his kind. Their
timeline was lost forever.

The traveller waits for the dawn of understanding. He waits for the
inexorable march of evolution.

The raindrops danced across the window pane, casting shadows in the gloom,
on the traveller who waits with the patience of endless ages.
