# Light

The beauty of nature,<br>
Promise of the wondrous future,<br>
The light of our minds,<br>
May we one day find,<br>
The bliss of childhood.

The clear waters that once did flow,<br>
Now are muddy, no longer they glow.<br>
How I wish for the spring in my step,<br>
With which I greeted life at every step,<br>
For the young vigour of my view,<br>
Those who are still fresh and new,<br>
Are indeed a blessed few.<br>
May the stars shine on them,<br>
Who light and kindle flame.
