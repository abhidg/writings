# Light

The beauty of nature,
Promise of the wondrous future,
The light of our minds,
May we one day find,
The bliss of childhood.

The clear waters that once did flow,
Now are muddy, no longer they glow.
How I wish for the spring in my step,
With which I greeted life at every step,
For the young vigour of my view,
Those who are still fresh and new,
Are indeed a blessed few.
May the stars shine on them,
Who light and kindle flame.
