# Far from my land

Deep 'neath the stars was I born,
Looking with hope unto the world,
A world of exquisite beauty, versatility,
Which amazed me with its profundity.

Great light came forth me,
But alas! The shadows were hovering,
Shadows that do not kill or maim,
Shadows that are far worse --
`
For they bind the soul; unfettered it remains not,
It cries out in pain, but the shackles don't give way,
It pushes and shoves, but in vain,
While things of beauty before him smile, and fade.

Can beauty be regained? Can the mind be free?
Is it possible in the land of shadows,
Where men lie, cheat, deceive and break but rarely mend.
Where light is crushed, rarely kindled.

We need a light powerful and profound,
To break through the darkening gloom,
The sun rises in far-off lands, hardly in ours,
E'en if it does, it does caress the fading ones.

I long to leave, my task is done,
I've savored the warmth of this land,
Tasted the sweet, the bitter and many more,
But now I am tired, I long to rest, evermore.

Many hurdles bar my way, but
Cross them I must,
Free of the shackles of the shadows shall I then become,
Free of the land of my fathers.

Hope still does lie in the hearts of few,
Little flickering points, that glow
in the murky night, alas!
The seagulls can't take flight.

Before I part, I would like to say,
Many things are beautiful by the light of day,
Lose them not, for that's why we live, to enjoy
and to learn - the deepest of the world.

Above all, shine and fly,
Into the grimy past look not, for only sadness it brings,
The future is unknown, so turn your mind
to the present, the moment of creation.

Time, after all, is the ultimate teacher,
Wounds heal, sadness fades in the wheels of time,
Though some are not so blessed by Eru the One,
In his gift to men -- oblivion and death.

Oblivion - ah bliss! like the little children playing on the beach,
The innocent minds play, fluid and limpid they are,
The know not of the shadows, but they will learn,
For the shadows lie in wait; they feed on the mind.

Poverty, famine. disease and hunger would go away,
If one opened their minds to the world's glory,
Instead of the petty things that people covet,
If they got together and built.

Now, the time has come, I must part,
The seagulls lift, borne by them,
I shall fly long out of reach,
Far, from the land of my birth.
