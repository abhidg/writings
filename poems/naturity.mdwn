# Naturity

The rippling of water in the brook,
The beautiful day, oh let's look!
Beauty's waiting outside,
It'd be a shame to stay inside.

The dew dropped grass under my feet,
The glistening water in the brook,
Make me cry out in delight,
In the glory of the wondrous light!

White spots on green,
Sheep on the field,
The murmuring in the brook,
Green moss in every nook,

The greenery, the verdure,
the wide great azure sky,
Filled with puffy clouds that fly,
and seagulls that cry.

Are all one and same,
in the universe it would seem,
We and every other creature,
Are but part of the harmony of Nature.
