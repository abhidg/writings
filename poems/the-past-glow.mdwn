# The Past Glow

Like feathers in the wind,
We used to fly, not knowing what we would find,
The great wide world was a wonder,
Always we used to think, what lay yonder?
And then -- we grew older.

Like the glimmer that is gone,
Like the fading light, that once was rich and full,
Our lives, once a variegated tapestry,
Once, when life was joy unbound,
Now alas! Greyness creeps upon the soul,
Sucking the colour so beautiful,

We remain still, and watch the years go by,
Watch how they change, watch the power of time,
To turn smiling infants into turbulent teens,
Then to senility -- our minds, we ourselves,
Subject to its ravages, change.

We then look, with our eyes, that are not
Now dancing, but poignant, thinking,
Those were the days, my friend,
When joy abound at every bend,
Now we search for joy in nooks and corners,
Not seeing, not feeling, that we
Are ourselves hoy; our glory we do not see.
And thus are blind, and thus are sad,
And thus we cannot smile like
An infant does, no worries in a mile.
