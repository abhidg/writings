# The Connection

Light springs 'pon the field,
Great power does he wield,
The one who sees,
The murmuring of bees,
The twitter of bords in the cherry trees,
How the threads bind,
and connect us all, how we may find,
The deep force that guides us all,
If we stop, and think.

Stay! The world rushes by,
A blur of colour and motion,
Streams of information seep through,
The fabric 'twhich we're knit,
In the rush, we fall, we hurt,
We forget the deep roots, our birth,
Is it too late, ain't this the time,
To set right once more, our unthinking wrong,
To perceive the truth, to feel the good?

Then, the world shall sing,
We shall cry, not of sadness,
but for what we shall become,
Afraid we are, of what we can be,
Times are there, when like mice we are,
We hide in the dark, waiting for the light,
Not knowing, for we are the source
Of light, of joy, of happiness, of anger and hate,
We choose, and feel, Rise and shine!
For it is time, once again.
