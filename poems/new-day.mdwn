# New day

Today is a new day,<br>
Our sorrows fall by the way,<br>
Purge us of our grief, I say.<br>
That we may find our way,<br>
Back to our homes, back to peace,<br>
To untarnished happiness and bliss.<br>
Grant me strength, my lord,<br>
That we may fearless face the world.<br>
Strong that we may remain,<br>
In face of darkness, in face of pain,<br>
That we may have the power to smile,<br>
That our light may not go out,<br>
When all other light fails.
