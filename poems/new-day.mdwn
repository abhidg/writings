# New day

Today is a new day,
Our sorrows fall by the way,
Purge us of our grief, I say.
That we may find our way,
Back to our homes, back to peace,
To untarnished happiness and bliss.
Grant me strength, my lord,
That we may fearless face the world.
Strong that we may remain,
In face of darkness, in face of pain,
That we may have the power to smile,
That our light may not go out,
When all other light fails.
