# Special Lectures

Come every Wednesday, without fail,<br>
The Special Lectures arrive.<br>
Electrifying our neurons, segfaulting our mind,<br>
They traverse the thought graph<br>
With impunity.

At 1500, the lights go on, the time has come!<br>
For the next Lecture to become.<br>
The light projects and letters blink<br>
The projector is on with hardly a wink.<br>

The Lecture goes on and ever on<br>
Jolts are heard, as elbows are pushed<br>
To retrieve minds from somnolent bliss.<br>
People awake and drift off 'gain<br>
The slide changes.

'Tis true that they interest us oft<br>
But Knowledge, squeezed<br>
Compressed and gzipped,<br>
Can also turn into something else...

Especially when it flocks 'to our ears<br>
Trying to understand, trying<br>
But low bandwidth sends It flying<br>
Out of our minds, out of the moment<br>
Only the chatter and the blinking lights.

Clap, clap, the hands fall,<br>
What happened? You see It's gone.<br>
But, never fear -- right and true<br>
Just as the sun rises every morn<br>
It shall be there.<br>
Next week.
