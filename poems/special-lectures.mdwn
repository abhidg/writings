# Special Lectures

Come every Wednesday, without fail,
The Special Lectures arrive.
Electrifying our neurons, segfaulting our mind,
They traverse the thought graph
With impunity.

At 1500, the lights go on, the time has come!
For the next Lecture to become.
The light projects and letters blink
The projector is on with hardly a wink.

The Lecture goes on and ever on
Jolts are heard, as elbows are pushed
To retrieve minds from somnolent bliss.
People awake and drift off 'gain
The slide changes.

'Tis true that they interest us oft
But Knowledge, squeezed
Compressed and gzipped,
Can also turn into something else...

Especially when it flocks 'to our ears
Trying to understand, trying
But low bandwidth sends It flying
Out of our minds, out of the moment
Only the chatter and the blinking lights.

Clap, clap, the hands fall,
What happened? You see It's gone.
But, never fear -- right and true
Just as the sun rises every morn
It shall be there.
Next week.
