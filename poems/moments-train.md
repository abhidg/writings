# Moments on a train

I feel bored  
Grass-fields pass by  
Mocking me as they fly  
Past me and away.

Stone chips and rails  
Swiftly move in a blur  
The overcast sky, unmoving  
Mirrors my thoughts.

Inside, the lights are on  
but bright it is not  
My senses are dulled by an  
endless monotone.

Moving and yet same  
A paradox, is it not?  
The smell of tea wafts in  
Invigorating.

A bell sounds, a mobile rings  
Jarring, the sound is  
Shaking me, startling me  
Even as I write this.

The world turns towards night  
Darker the sky becomes  
The colours are washed out  
As are my senses.

Yet all is not dark out,  
Spots of light dot the terrain  
the photons rush out and  
hit my eyes with glee.

An industrial plant, a giant  
of manmade might, is sprinkled  
with points of yellow and white  
In a second, gone.

We pass through cities  
We pass through dreams  
We're just like dark matter,
Non-interacting.

A reddish glow is all that remains  
of the once mighty sun ruling the heavens  
It is fading like the light  
Now a reddish streak.

Looking out through tinted glasses  
Just like how we see  
A moving animation sweeps by  
In a tiny frame.

I ask the time, 'tis still a while  
Before we reach journey's end  
Seconds creep by and at times  
Seem to stop.

The green turns to black  
Dark shapes nod in the scape  
Heedless they've remained, and  
thus will stay for years.

A bridge slithers by  
With a stream underneath  
Featureless though is the water  
Pale, softly serene.

Like a snapshot of stillness  
agains the changing environs  
We move on, the clock ticks  
and now are closer.

The boredom returns  
With renewed ferocity  
Everything is eerily quiet  
Only the door creaks.

Like waves in a pond  
Voices rise and fall  
A peddler passes, a baby cries  
The sound of flowing tea.

Ah! The train has stopped  
But now it starts again  
Moving slowly at first  
Then gathering speed.

A row of lights pass by
It is another train  
More like us, going somewhere
Some of them, bored.

The effect of Doppler
Sounds into my ear
Muted though by glass
Fast, it rushes past

Like a century, it is
How long a journey it seems
The same things repeat
over and over.

Even the words grow boring
My patience grows thin
I ask the time again
Ninety minutes left.

An old man speaks to a
Reader of books
Someone throws food into
A dusty dustbin.

Soon in the future
This tapestry will be done
The journey will have finished
and I'll be at rest.

The locomotive whirls on
Infinity passes, stops
And passes again.
And then we are there.
At last.
