# Naturity

The rippling of water in the brook,<br>
The beautiful day, oh let's look!<br>
Beauty's waiting outside,<br>
It'd be a shame to stay inside.

The dew dropped grass under my feet,<br>
The glistening water in the brook,<br>
Make me cry out in delight,<br>
In the glory of the wondrous light!

White spots on green,<br>
Sheep on the field,<br>
The murmuring in the brook,<br>
Green moss in every nook,

The greenery, the verdure,<br>
the wide great azure sky,<br>
Filled with puffy clouds that fly,<br>
and seagulls that cry.

Are all one and same,<br>
in the universe it would seem,<br>
We and every other creature,<br>
Are but part of the harmony of Nature.
