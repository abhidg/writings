# Lines

O the long straight lines
Lines that divide, lines that create,
Lines that change destiny,
That bring wars and misery.

Lines build walls, invisible but strong,
Their reach is long,
They create history, and ain't it a mystery,
How such things can change the world?

Lines of thinking restrict
The boundless creativity they do constrict,
The world becomes drab and gray,
Without colour and spark of a single ray.

Yet lines also are beauty,
In the coloured lines of spectra,
We comprehend the universe,
The lines are the beautiful evidence.

So my friends, lines and curves,
We must be there, all of us,
For it's beauty for which we care
Come let's create beauty rare!
