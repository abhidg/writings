# Lines

O the long straight lines<br>
Lines that divide, lines that create,<br>
Lines that change destiny,<br>
That bring wars and misery.<br>

Lines build walls, invisible but strong,<br>
Their reach is long,<br>
They create history, and ain't it a mystery,<br>
How such things can change the world?<br>

Lines of thinking restrict<br>
The boundless creativity they do constrict,<br>
The world becomes drab and gray,<br>
Without colour and spark of a single ray.

Yet lines also are beauty,<br>
In the coloured lines of spectra,<br>
We comprehend the universe,<br>
The lines are the beautiful evidence.

So my friends, lines and curves,<br>
We must be there, all of us,<br>
For it's beauty for which we care<br>
Come let's create beauty rare!
