# The Connection

Light springs 'pon the field,<br>
Great power does he wield,<br>
The one who sees,<br>
The murmuring of bees,<br>
The twitter of bords in the cherry trees,<br>
How the threads bind,<br>
and connect us all, how we may find,<br>
The deep force that guides us all,<br>
If we stop, and think.

Stay! The world rushes by,<br>
A blur of colour and motion,<br>
Streams of information seep through,<br>
The fabric 'twhich we're knit,<br>
In the rush, we fall, we hurt,<br>
We forget the deep roots, our birth,<br>
Is it too late, ain't this the time,<br>
To set right once more, our unthinking wrong,<br>
To perceive the truth, to feel the good?

Then, the world shall sing,<br>
We shall cry, not of sadness,<br>
but for what we shall become,<br>
Afraid we are, of what we can be,<br>
Times are there, when like mice we are,<br>
We hide in the dark, waiting for the light,<br>
Not knowing, for we are the source<br>
Of light, of joy, of happiness, of anger and hate,<br>
We choose, and feel, Rise and shine!<br>
For it is time, once again.
