# Nature

We have come! We have come!
The grass in the woods grow
and the iridescent river flows
Spring has come! Spring has come!
Far away on the deep blue sea
We can hear the gulls fly in glee
The fountain waters the rabbit hole
And all we know is green and gold
The flowers greet the midday sun
and oh! we'll have so much fun!

Under the cool green forest leaves,
in the mid-morning sun
the flowers bloom and bees hum
and the faint mist clears in a glade
The rippling of waters in a brook
ir the flight of a squirrel in a nearbly crook
Are things that no one sees but one can feel
As the fire sets in the East
and the birds fly to their nests
The stars twinkle and in the heavens play
The world around is gleefully gay.

* * *

As exquisite as a flower in bloom
ir a night sky under a full moon
As high as the mountains
and the flowing water from fountains
Must our thoughts be.
