# Nature

We have come! We have come!<br>
The grass in the woods grow<br>
and the iridescent river flows<br>
Spring has come! Spring has come!<br>
Far away on the deep blue sea<br>
We can hear the gulls fly in glee<br>
The fountain waters the rabbit hole<br>
And all we know is green and gold<br>
The flowers greet the midday sun<br>
and oh! we'll have so much fun!

Under the cool green forest leaves,<br>
in the mid-morning sun<br>
the flowers bloom and bees hum<br>
and the faint mist clears in a glade<br>
The rippling of waters in a brook<br>
ir the flight of a squirrel in a nearbly crook<br>
Are things that no one sees but one can feel<br>
As the fire sets in the East<br>
and the birds fly to their nests<br>
The stars twinkle and in the heavens play<br>
The world around is gleefully gay.

As exquisite as a flower in bloom<br>
ir a night sky under a full moon<br>
As high as the mountains<br>
and the flowing water from fountains<br>
Must our thoughts be.
