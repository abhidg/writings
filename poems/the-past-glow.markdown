# The Past Glow

Like feathers in the wind,<br>
We used to fly, not knowing what we would find,<br>
The great wide world was a wonder,<br>
Always we used to think, what lay yonder?<br>
And then -- we grew older.

Like the glimmer that is gone,<br>
Like the fading light, that once was rich and full,<br>
Our lives, once a variegated tapestry,<br>
Once, when life was joy unbound,<br>
Now alas! Greyness creeps upon the soul,<br>
Sucking the colour so beautiful,

We remain still, and watch the years go by,<br>
Watch how they change, watch the power of time,<br>
To turn smiling infants into turbulent teens,<br>
Then to senility -- our minds, we ourselves,<br>
Subject to its ravages, change.

We then look, with our eyes, that are not<br>
Now dancing, but poignant, thinking,<br>
Those were the days, my friend,<br>
When joy abound at every bend,<br>
Now we search for joy in nooks and corners,<br>
Not seeing, not feeling, that we<br>
Are ourselves hoy; our glory we do not see.<br>
And thus are blind, and thus are sad,<br>
And thus we cannot smile like<br>
An infant does, no worries in a mile.
