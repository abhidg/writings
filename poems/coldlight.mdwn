# Cold Light

Swiftly the wind blows, hark! he is near<br>
One day we must all meet him, no fear<br>
Proud and erect I stand facing the dawn<br>
The first cold light strikes the lawn.

The brooding light far from its yellowish youth<br>
Shines blood red upon the scorching earth.<br>
All traces of green have faded to dust<br>
Prepare for our destiny we must.

The countdown has started, we're leaving<br>
this home of many decades that I loved<br>
Yet I stay and preserve what I can<br>
what was once a beautiful place.

Night shall soon fall upon my home<br>
Though there shall be n#one to witness<br>
The last gust of fiery wind<br>
Shall blow the candle out.
