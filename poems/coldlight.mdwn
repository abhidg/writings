# Cold Light

Swiftly the wind blows, hark! he is near
One day we must all meet him, no fear
Proud and erect I stand facing the dawn
The first cold light strikes the lawn.

The brooding light far from its yellowish youth
Shines blood red upon the scorching earth.
All traces of green have faded to dust
Prepare for our destiny we must.

The countdown has started, we're leaving
this home of many decades that I loved
Yet I stay and preserve what I can
what was once a beautiful place.

Night shall soon fall upon my home
Though there shall be n#one to witness
The last gust of fiery wind
Shall blow the candle out.
